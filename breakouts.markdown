## Breakout Discussions

Before we get started with hands-on work within the Jupyter Notebook environment, we want to have some smaller group discussions about challenges we typically face in our job contexts. We will divide into breakout rooms and tackle the individual datasets. More context on them is below.

### Overview

  - Overview of the sample datasets
  - Discussion of challenges involving large or complicated data
  - Share outs, reflections, and ideas

### Key Questions

  - What ethical tensions exist regarding the collection and public release of this data?
  - What is the risk of privacy disclosure in each dataset?
  - Do the people detailed in these data have a right to privacy?
  - Should this data or data like it be open to the public?
  - How could data misrepresent the reality?
  - Are there any immediate difficulties involved with answering these questions?
