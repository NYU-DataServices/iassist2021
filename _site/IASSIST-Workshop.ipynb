    "# Deidentification by Design: Creating Ethical Data Derivatives with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview** \n",
    "\n",
    "Research and proprietary data often contain personally identifiable information, with variables that reveal details about the lives of individuals and may have been collected without the personâ€™s knowledge or consent. Datasets aggregated at the individual level often interest social science scholars, yet such data poses a risk of identification and create an ethical dilemma for curators.\n",
    " \n",
    "While some types of information and data are legally protected, other social data, such as home mortgage files, voter registration files, and tax parcel records are public and are often augmented with modeled indicators, such as religious belief or personal income, that may not represent the reality of people's lives.  Library information and data specialists must develop infrastructure, workflows, and policies to ensure the ethical stewardship and use of these datasets.  This interactive workshop will explore the tension between making purchased data as widely accessible to researchers as possible, while also ensuring that sensitive data is not abused. \n",
    " \n",
    "Following a short discussion of some of the above challenges, we will introduce technologies and workflows for data de-identification via hands-on activities in you will create redacted samples of data that maintain research integrity and usefulness. Learning outcomes include:\n",
    " \n",
    "1) Develop fluency with generating random samples in order to make analysis with large files more manageable\n",
    "2) Know how to assess the identification risk of specific variables within a dataset in order to protect the identity of human subjects\n",
    "3) Create a Jupyter Notebook workflow that enables cleaning, redacting, and sharing data for research use\n",
    "4) Learn some fundamental Pandas features for exploring, cleaning, and transforming data\n",
    "\n",
    "**About the Sample Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The L2 Political files come in two parts for each state: Demographic indicators and Voter History. Both are .tab files (tab delimited) and will need to be extracted. It is likely that you'll need to use a command line tool like The Unarchiver to decompress each archive. \n",
    "\n",
    "For larger states, you will want to redact parts of these files by only loading the minimum number of variables that you need into memory, merge them together, then sample them in order to perform analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to provide some guidance on working with the data and creating extracts in a memory-efficient manner. It uses Python Libraries that are included with the Anacondas distribution, with the exception of [Pyjanitor](https://pyjanitor.readthedocs.io/index.html). In order to install it, run\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install pyjanitor -c conda-forge`\n",
    "\n",
    "The conda distribution here seems to work the best (as opposed to pip). See the documentation for each of these libraries (especially Pandas) for more information. You will need to restart your Kernel and notebook before proceeding if you haven't already installed Pyjanitor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users are expected to have agreed to the Terms of Use and should create redacted versions of the data that strip out identifying information and load only variables that are important for analysis. For the latest documentation, visit the [L2 Political LibGuide](https://guides.nyu.edu/l2political)"
