Datasets aggregated at the individual level often interest social science scholars, yet such data poses a risk of identification and create an ethical dilemma for curators. While some types of information and data are legally protected, other social data, such as home mortgage files, voter registration files, and tax parcel records are public and are often augmented with modeled indicators, such as religious belief or personal income, that may not represent the reality of people’s lives. Library information and data specialists must develop infrastructure, workflows, and policies to ensure the ethical stewardship and use of these datasets. ### Workshop Learning Objectives 1. Develop fluency with generating random samples in order to make analysis with large files more manageable 2. Know how to assess the identification risk of specific variables within a dataset in order to protect the identity of human subjects 3. Create a Jupyter Notebook workflow that enables cleaning, redacting, and sharing data for research use 4. Learn some fundamental Pandas features for exploring, cleaning, and transforming data ",

    "content": "## Getting ready for the workshop In our workshop, we will be using Python 3 and the Jupyter Notebook environment in order to work with our sample data. We highly encourage participants to install everything in advance of the session and download the sample files, if possible. If anyone gets stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to the workshop conveners, Andrew Battista, Katie Wissel, and Daniel Hickey. ### Table of Contents - [Installation instructions](#installation-instructions) - [Getting the data](#getting-the-data) - [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) ### Installation instructions 1. **Download and Install Python with the Anaconda 3 distribution.** Although there are many ways to install and run Python, and still many more ways to install the Anaconda 3 distribution and accompanying libraries, we are going to recommend using the appropriate graphical installer from Anaconda. + __Mac__ [instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/) (*Note: When you get to step 6, select \"install for me only\" and install it in a location on your personal user account.*) + __Windows__ [instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) (*Note: Make sure to select \"just for me\" and select the box that registers your Anaconda as the default Python 3.x. You may find these [instructions and video tutorial](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/setup.html) to be helpful.*) + __Linux__ [instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) 2. **Install the `pyjanitor` library** Our workshop will be using several libraries that come standard with the Anaconda distribution, but one does not: [pyjanitor](https://pyjanitor.readthedocs.io/installation.html). In order to install it, we recommend using the `conda` command. + __On Mac or Linux:__ Open a bash prompt, e.g., `Terminal` and run the command ``` conda install pyjanitor -c conda-forge ``` + __On Windows:__ Your new Anacondas installation should have installed a program called `Anaconda Prompt`. Open it and run the command ``` conda install pyjanitor -c conda-forge ``` ### Getting the Data __Download the contents of this private [Box folder](https://nyu.app.box.com/folder/135087745557).__ To do so, you will need a Box account using the email address you used when registering for the workshop. ### Troubleshooting We have discovered that problems can occur when users have previously installed Anaconda 3 on their machine. If this is happening, the best thing to do is uninstall your Anaconda 3 and then re-install it, making sure you have followed the above directions. [TO DO] ",
